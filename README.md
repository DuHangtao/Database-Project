# Database-Project
QwikTix

Welcome to QwikTix! Here you will find our database application that simulates a combination of IMDB, Fandango, and Apple's TV app.

Through this application, a user can register to QwikTix and stream movies or buy tickets from a local theatre. Users can also search movies and details such as the directors, producers, and actors (characters) of a movie. The database also keeps track of what movies the user has loved, viewed, and searched.

Through this database application, QwikTix will take over the movie tickets industry!

Programs:

ddl.sql : SQL that instantiates our normalized relations in DB Browser - Open DB Browser - Create a new database called: DatabaseApp.sqlite - Paste dml_1, dml2, and dml3, respectively into the Execute SQL section of the browser - Hit the play button - Now all the tables of this database have been created

dml.sql : SQL that populates the tables - Paste this file into the Execute SQL section of the browser - Hit the play button - Now all the tables have been populated for this database

In order to execute queries, use the Execute SQL section of DB Browser to write your queries. Press the play nbutton and the result will be outputted in the bottom section.
